â—¬ As an adaptive, fast-learning, flexible full-stack software engineer, I am an innovative thinker, with a growth mindset and a passion for teamwork, problem-solving, and pattern mapping. I have experience with many different modern web technologies including React.js, Typescript, Node.js & PostgreSQL, while constantly exploring new ways to improve the world through code.

Currently inspired by the latest in 3D animation(s) through programming (GSAP & Three.js).

â—¬ In another life, I used to be a virtual nomad, running an online e-commerce business on my computer from anywhere in the world. At some point along the way, I missed contributing to a team and became more curious about how I may someday improve the systems that ran the platforms I'd been working on for so long.
